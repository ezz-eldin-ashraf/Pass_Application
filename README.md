# ***1. Project overview***

***Pass is a smart mobile application designed to simplify the reservation process for small football playgrounds. The app aims to eliminate the traditional manual process of booking by providing a digital platform that connects playground owners with players.***

***Through Pass, users can easily find available fields, make instant reservations, and manage their bookings all in one place. The app also includes additional features such as a football-focused community, a management dashboard for field owners, real-time booking notifications, a built-in store for football-related products, and interactive challenges between teams.***

***Pass creates an all-in-one digital ecosystem that transforms the way people play, book, and connect through football.***

## ***1.1 Project idea***

***The idea behind Pass came from a common problem faced by football players in many neighborhoods. Booking a small football field often requires going to the location physically, meeting the owner, negotiating the time, and paying a cash deposit. This process is time-consuming, inconvenient, and outdated.***

***To solve this issue, we came up with the concept of creating a mobile application that streamlines the entire booking process. With just a few taps, users can view available times, make secure bookings, receive reminders, and even join a community of players. The goal is to make football more accessible, social, and organized through smart technology.***
